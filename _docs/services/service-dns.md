**DNS queries** produce listing calls Resource Records. This is a representation of Resource Records:

## Enumeration

First we will need to a Reverse DNS Lookup,

With **Reverse DNS Lookup**, we will receive the IP address associated to a given domain name.

```
# With nslookup
nslookup
> server IP_DNS_SERVER
> IP

# With dig
dig -x IP @IP_DNS_SERVER
```

There are usually two name servers. Take note of both of them an run the next command to show all A records:

```
nslookup -query=AXFR [Domain] [Nameserver]
dig axfr DOMAIN.LOCAL @IP_DNS_SERVER
```

Finally, just add the DNS records to you `/etc/hosts`.
