The server run on a **supported Linux** systems. To start the team server, execute the following command:

```
./teamserver <IP> <Password> <Malleable C2 Profile>

[+] Team server is up on 0.0.0.0:50050
[*] SHA256 hash of SSL cert is: eadd46ff4f74d582290ce1755513ddfc0ffd736f90bed5d8d662ee113faccb43

Verify the server's fingerprint before connecting.

> **Important:** The team server allows multiple clients to connect at the same time. If remote team members needs to connect, you shouldn't expose port 50050 directly to internet. Use a secure remote access solution such as SSH or VPN.
