title: C2 - Cobalt Strike
category: Red Team
order: 3
---

**Cobalt Strike** was one of the first public red team command and control frameworks.

Red Teamers and penetration testers use Cobalt Strike to demonstrate the risk of a breach and evaluate mature security programs.

Cobalt Strike is split into client and a server components. 

Check more info in the official documentation.

# Installation

```
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security stretch/updates main'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
sudo apt install proxychains socat
sudo update-alternatives --config java #Select openjdk-11
```

# Starting the Team Server

The server, referred to as the team server, is the controller for the Beacon payload and the host for Cobalt Strikeâ€™s social engineering features. The team server also stores data collected by Cobalt Strike and it manages logging.

The server run on a **supported Linux** systems. To start the team server, execute the following command:

```
./teamserver <IP> <Password> <Malleable C2 Profile>

[*] Generating X509 certificate and keystore (for SSL)
[+] Team server is up on 0.0.0.0:50050
[*] SHA256 hash of SSL cert is: eadd46ff4f74d582290ce1755513ddfc0ffd736f90bed5d8d662ee113faccb43
```
Once started we can launch the client and connect with the password used.

Verify the server's fingerprint before connecting.

> **OPSEC Note:** The team server allows multiple clients to connect at the same time. If remote team members needs to connect, you shouldn't expose port 50050 directly to internet. Use a secure remote access solution such as SSH or VPN.


# Listeners

A listener is a host/port/protocol combination that listens for inconming communication from a beacon.

There are two types:

* **Egress**: This listener acts like a web server, where the Team Server and the Beacon will encapsulate their communication over HTTP protocol. These communications can be personalized such as bodies, headers, cookies, etc with the Malleable C2 Profile.

* **Peer-to-peer**: Allow beaacons to chain their communications together over TCP or SMB. These are particularly useful in cases where a machine that you compromise can not reach the team server directly.

In order to create a listener go to `Cobalt Strike -> Listeners` and click the button `Add`.

# Payloads

There are two types of payloads:

* **Staged**: Staged payloads are tiny, when executed the real shellcode is transfered and execute. 

* **Stageless**: It contains the whole shellcole which means is bigger than staged payloads.

> **OPSEC Note**: Staged payloads are useful when the delivery method is limited to an amount of data that we can send. However, they tend to have more indicators and is more detectable than stageless payloads.

Cobalt Strike can generate both staged and stageless payloads. On GUI if we see a `(S)` means that is *stageless*.

## Staged Payloads

Go to `Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable`:

## Stageless Payloads

Go to `Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable (S)`:

> **OPSEC Note**: The use of 64-bit payloads on 64-bit Operating Systems is preferable to using 32-bit payloads on 64-bit Operating Systems.

## Help <command>

We can also get help of a command with `help <command>`:

```
beacon> help sleep
Use: sleep [time in seconds] <jitter>

Change how often the beacon calls home. Use sleep 0 to force Beacon to call 
home many times each second. 

Specify a jitter value (0-99) to force Beacon to randomly modify its sleep time.
```

> **Note**: Parameters wrapped in `[ ]` are mandatory, whilst those in `< >` are optional although the default value maybe in not the best option.



## Sleep

With `sleep` command we can modify the time when the beacon checks into the team server, by default is setted to 60 seconds.

```
beacon> sleep 5
[*] Tasked beacon to sleep for 5s
[+] host called home, sent: 16 bytes
```

> **OPSEC Note**: Set a fast check-in can increase the chance of detection, it is also recommended to use a jitter which randomize the check-in time by a given percentage.

## Execute Assembly

The `execute-assembly` command allows the beacon to run `.NET` executables directly from memory.

```
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Tool.exe
```

# Hosting Files

Cobalt Strike allows us to host files in his web server. Go to `Attacks -> Web Drive-by -> Host File`.
